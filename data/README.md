# data sources

I just copy-pasted data from wikipedia pages to website files. There is a
possibly scrapable french election site, but why do that when someone in the
wikiworld already did?

Data sources:

+ [Census and Population Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_departments_by_population)
+ [Election Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_presidential_election,_2017)
